## Part 3 - Inventory your Databases

Your organisation is going to have systems of records.  They are databases, fileshares, blob storage where information is persisted.
Start anywhere and capture a list of Databases at your organisation.

We are capturing logical definitions only.  You might have 1 or more copies of database in each one of your logical environments but we only need to document it once.

#### Overview 
A description of the Database which contains a business defintion so that it is useful for all audiences.

#### Used by
A link to other Application pages which consume this Database.  e.g The Customers Database is used by the Customers API

#### Source Control
If this Database is managed through source control is versioned when changes are deployed, link to the repository that contains the changes.
