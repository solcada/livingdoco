## Set up an Area for Issues, Risks and Decisions

"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate." - Carl Jung.



#### Issue log

You may already have a IT system for tracking issues, the key thing here is that you have a process and a scope for the the issues.  e.g project issues, product issues, organisational issues and that these issues are escalated if they are at a level where the person being affected by it, cannot resolve it.  Its important to have a clear owner for an issue.
